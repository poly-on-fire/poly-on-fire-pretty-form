# Pretty Form

This wouldn't be necessary if I wasn't lame at CSS and thus needed to experiment in an isolated environment

* Make everything paper elements so validate() will already work in iron-form
* Make allowed-pattern from iron-input work in paper input
* Utilize just enough hacky-css and crappy design to eliminate at least the first layer of confusion in the user's mind when she attempts to use the input form.
