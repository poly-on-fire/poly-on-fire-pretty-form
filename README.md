##### A project for learning an aspect of developing a Polymer app, deployed on Firebase hosting.

The idea is to prove out an approach or component in the simplest project first, before combining it with other code in a real project.

# \<poly-on-fire-pretty-form\>

## What it does:

an isolated look at doing CSS for making forms pretty

This is only necessary because I suck at CSS so isolating it while working on it helps

## Starter Kit

This project started out as a starter kit project, then form was added to view1

## Objectives

* Everything paper-[...] elements so that iron-form validate() already working
* Experiment with CSS such that paper elements are not confusing
* Experiment with vaadin combo in present (no material design currently) co-exists without creating disjunct physical appearance - probably by wrapping in card div
